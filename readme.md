The CSS is generated by a Python script stored in the 'code' along with the source art assets.

# Details

Cards blocks are created by creating a div with class "card<size>, where size is either "small", "medium", or "large", and optional "hand" class then adding i-tags with a card synonym class."

Example:

```html
<div class="large hand">
  <i class="ace-of-spades">ace-of-spades</i>
  <i class="ten-of-spades">ten-of-spades</i>
</div>
```

Synonyms of card classes are available in these templates:

- `<cardName>-of-<suit>`
- `_<cardNumber>-of-<suit>`
- `_<cardNumber><suit>`
- `<suit>-<card>`
- `<suit><card>`

The four standard suits are defined as plural, singular, and first-initial.

- `hearts`
- `spades`
- `diamonds`
- `clubs`

Cards are defined with numbers (leading zero or without), and alternate names.

- `02`, `2`, `two`
